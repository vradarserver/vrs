HOW TO ADD YOUR OWN TILE SERVER SETTINGS
========================================

It is a requirement for most free tile servers that the program does not hard
code their address and that there is some way to remove support for a tile
server if their operators request it.

To that end VRS downloads a copy of the tile server settings from the SDM site
once a day. The downloaded settings are stored in a file called:

    TileServerSettings-Downloaded.json.

DO NOT CHANGE THE SETTINGS IN THAT FILE. Your changes will be overwritten.

If you are running your own tile server, or you want to use a tile server that
is not in the main set of downloaded tile server settings, then you can tell
VRS about the server by creating a file called:

                        TileServerSettings-Custom.json

in the same directory as these instructions. The file is a normal text file. In
the file you will need to paste everything between the //----- lines below:

//------ start of file: copy from below this line
[
  {
    "MapProvider": "Leaflet",
    "DisplayOrder": 1,
    "Name": "-- FILL IN YOUR NAME HERE --",
    "Url": "-- FILL IN THE URL USING LEAFLET SPECIFICATIONS --",
    "Attribution": "-- FILL IN ATTRIBUTIONS HERE --",
    "Subdomains": null,
    "Version": null,
    "MinZoom": null,
    "MaxZoom": null,
    "ZoomOffset": null,
    "MinNativeZoom": null,
    "MaxNativeZoom": null,
    "ZoomReverse": false,
    "DetectRetina": false,
    "ClassName": null,
    "ExpandoOptions": [],

    /* New settings from version 2.4.5 onwards: */
    "ErrorTileUrl": null,
    "IsTms": false,
    "IsLayer": false,
    "DefaultBrightness": 100,
    "DefaultOpacity": 100
  }
]
//----- end of file: copy to the line above this one

Most of the fields are optional and can be left as null. The fields that are
NOT optional are: 
  * MapProvider (leave this as Leaflet)
  * DisplayOrder (if you have multiple entries then the lowest values are
    displayed first, otherwise leave as 1)
  * Name (must be unique across all your custom entries)
  * Url
  * Attribution

If you supply a non-null value for a string field then you need to surround the
value with quotes. String fields are:
  * MapProvider (always leave this as Leaflet)
  * Name
  * Url
  * Subdomains
  * ClassName
  * Attribution
  * ErrorTileUrl

If you supply a boolean value then you must use either true or false. Boolean
fields are:
  * ZoomReverse
  * DetectRetina
  * IsTms
  * IsLayer
Examples are:
    "ZoomReverse": true,
    "DetectRetina": false,
  
If you supply a non-null numeric value then you must not surround it in quotes.
Numeric fields are:
  * MinZoom
  * MaxZoom
  * ZoomOffset
  * MinNativeZoom
  * MaxNativeZoom
  * DefaultBrightness
  * DefaultOpacity
Examples are:
    "MinZoom": null,
    "MaxZoom": 19,

    
CHOOSING A NAME
===============
If you specify more than one tile server then the names for each tile server
must be unique. Your names will be prefixed with "*" in the VRS user
interface.


URL
===
The tile server URL must follow Leaflet's rules for specifying a tile server
URL. At time of writing their documentation can be found here:

https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.0.html#tilelayer


ATTRIBUTION
===========
Any HTML you put into the attribution string will be shown to the user as text.
You cannot enter raw HTML here. However, you can use the following tags - these
will be turned into HTML when the map is created:

[c] becomes a copyright symbol
[a href=YOUR-HYPERLINK-ADDRESS-HERE]some text[/a] is transformed into a link
[attribution NAME] is replaced with the attribution from the tile server
setting called NAME


BRIGHTNESS AND OPACITY
======================
In the first version of the tile server settings brightness was implied by using
classes. From version 2.4.5 onwards this is no longer the case, brightness has
its own setting. Brightness values range from 10 (dark) to 100 (full brightness)
to 150 (50% extra bright) in steps of 10.

Brightness only applies to maps, it does not get used for layers.

Opacity is a new setting in version 2.4.5. It has a range of 0 (transparent) to
100 (opaque) in steps of 10. Opacity is only applied to layers, it is not applied
to maps.


OTHER SETTINGS
==============
At the moment all of the other settings are a subset of the settings that can
be specified when creating Leaflet tile layers. See Leaflet's documentation,
which at time of writing is:

https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.0.html#tilelayer

Note that only the single-string version of subdomains is supported.
    

EXPANDO OPTIONS
===============    
ExpandoOptions are extra options that you want VRS to use when creating maps.
If your tile server needs non-standard options like API keys then this is where
you specify them. The ExpandoOptions are an array of objects where each object
has these fields (all strings):

{
    "Option":  "OptionName",
    "Value":   "Value"
}

So if you wanted to add these two new fields to the tile layer options:

  apiKey = ABC123
  version = 7
  
Then your expando options entry in the file would look like this:

[
  {
    "MapProvider": "Leaflet",
    "DisplayOrder": 1,
    "Name": "-- FILL IN YOUR NAME HERE --",
    "Url": "-- FILL IN THE URL USING LEAFLET SPECIFICATIONS --",
    "Attribution": "-- FILL IN ATTRIBUTIONS HERE --",
    "Subdomains": null,
    "Version": null,
    "MinZoom": null,
    "MaxZoom": null,
    "ZoomOffset": null,
    "MinNativeZoom": null,
    "MaxNativeZoom": null,
    "ZoomReverse": false,
    "DetectRetina": false,
    "ClassName": null,
    "ExpandoOptions":
    [
      {
          "Option": "apiKey",
          "Value": "ABC123"
      },
      {
          "Option": "version",
          "Value": "7"
      }
    ]
  }
]

Only single string expando values are supported - no arrays, objects etc.
